# PET SIM 
Heroku link: https://nameless-peak-24752.herokuapp.com
## ABOUT
For my last project for SEI, I wanted to create a virtual pet sim game like Tamagotchi or Nintendogs. The game requires you to feed your animal everyday or couple of hours to make sure it stays alive. 


## PLANNING
For my planning, I spent a bit of time in the design phase figuring out what the app should approx look like in Figma. From there, I broke the broke down into an MVP to be able to at least do the following:
- Feed the pet
- It gets hungry
- Walks to side to side
- Login

The other features included: 
- Minigames (difficulty based off pet emotion)
- Pet does poopies
- Shop
- Pet hatches from egg (Click it multiple times to open)
- Give pet accesories

## Future Updates
- Make the feeding and hunger functional 
- UI Updates
- Bonus features
